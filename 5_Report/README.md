In 1903 Mary Anderson patented the first windshield wiper. While riding a streetcar in New York City in 1902 during a rainstorm, Anderson noticed that the streetcar operator was struggling with extremely poor visibility, causing him to open his window and stick his head out. Upon seeing this, Anderson automatically began drawing up the design for a windshield wiper operated by the driver to help improve visibility.This manual mechanism operated a set of wood and rubber arms with a lever, helping clear away snow, rain, and debris. Anderson’s invention never took off, though, and she never truly benefited financially from the invention.

In 1919 The automatic windshield wiper was introduced by William M. Folberth.It wasn’t until 1916 that windshield wipers were standard equipment on most vehicles, allowing for further advancements in the technology.William M. Folberth,  patented the first automatic, non-hand-driven windshield wipers in 1919. These automatic windshield wipers used a vacuum-powered system to clear the windshield, which became standard equipment on automobiles. This vacuum-powered system was widely used until 1960s, when the use of intermittent wipers became more common.
In 1969 Robert Kearns introduces the intermittent windshield wiper different inventors patented the idea of intermittent wipers, but the idea truly took hold thanks to Robert Kearns, an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Kearns’ invention was brought to the attention of the Ford Motor Company when he proposed manufacturing the design. While this proposal led to a patent dispute between the American carmaker and Kearns, the invention also led us to the windshield wipers we have today.


 German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz offers an advanced windshield washing system Magic Vision Control in its premium segment vehicles. This system incorporates heated wiper blade systems for winter weather conditions along with a wipe-and-wash configuration. Other leading European automakers like Audi and BMW are also offering advanced technology in the automotive wiper systems.
Wipers are one of the most critical safety components on any vehicle, but sometimes they also cause a distraction by their movement on the windshield. To prevent this diversion, McLaren, a British automotive manufacturer, has come up with ultrasonic force fields to replace wipers. McLaren has developed a new automotive windshield cleaning technology, the idea of which has been derived from fighter jets.
Advances in the field of wiper blade technology are evident with the development of new systems that promise to provide clear visibility of the road ahead. Automotive component designers and developers are developing wiper blade systems that deliver faster response time and streak-free visibility in extreme weather conditions. The advanced heated wiper blade system consists of the heated fluid within the blade frame, which is used to provide a clear, streak-free view of the road ahead. It offers maximum convenience when ice freezes on the windshield and aids in wiping out salt stains from the windshield. The technology not only helps in removing snow and ice but also aids drivers in getting rid of dust and dirt.

## INTRODUCTION:
A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water or debris from a vehicle's front window. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and watercraft with a cabin and some aircraft are equipped with one or more such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement. A wiper generally consists of a metal arm one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water, other precipitation, or any other impediments to visibility, from its surface. On vehicles made after 1969, the speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds, and often one or more intermittent settings. On some vehicles, a windscreen washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper to dry or icy conditions. This system sprays water, or an antifreeze window washer fluid, at the windscreen using several well-positioned nozzles. This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when it is used in concert with the wiper blades. When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers remove snow or ice. For these types of winter conditions, some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows, embedded heating wires in the glass in the wiper blade; these defroster systems can melt ice or help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen.



## WORKING PROCESS

*   The RED LED is considered for the ACC position. Once the push button is pressed for 2 seconds, the RED LED keeps continuously glowing until the stop of the engine signifying the engine condition to be turned ON.
*   On press of the user input push button, the other three Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency. The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
*   The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts with the next press.
*   If the push button is pressed for 2 seconds continuously, the RED light goes off and the pattern stops bringing it to default position which signifies the engine is turned OFF.

## SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strength
*   The wiper comes back to default position even if stooped in the middle
*   Safety for the driver as well as the passengers in the vehicle
*   Clear Visibility to the Driver for neat ride.

## Weakness
*   The total cost of the wiper system is high if implemented in real-time.
*   The major disadvantage is that STM32 contains only one button for all the operation
*   User has to undergo a sequence to acquire desired result and can't attain his result directly with the press of the button.

## Opportunities
*   Rain sensing and automatic operation can be implemented as further enhancement.

## Threats
*   Replacing the board is not possible if it malfunctions.
*   Can't have more functions as the functionality of the board is very basic.

## Components Used

## Stm32

The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the Arm® Cortex®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, low-power / low-voltage operation, and connectivity, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

## Servo Motor

A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.

## Resistors

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow.

## Capacitor

A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals. The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance.

## LED's

A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons.

## Cables and Connector

A cable, also known as a cord, plug, or connector transmits power or data between devices or positions, which is covered in plastic by one or more wires.

## Push Button

A push-button or simply button is a simple switch mechanism to control some aspect of a machine or a process. Buttons are typically made out of hard material, usually plastic or metal.
